# Documentation

Simple edits to documentation can be done with the [Github web-based editor](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-another-users-repository). Click on the "Edit this page" link on the page you want to edit, then open the file in your fork of the repository.

The documentation is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to transform [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) into HTML.

If you want to make more extensive alterations to the documentation, such as directory structure, styles, or HTML layout, it may be useful to [build the documentation site on your computer](/coding/docs-site.html) to preview your changes.
