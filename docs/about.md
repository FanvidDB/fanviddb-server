# About

FanvidDB is a fan-run project along the lines of [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) or [TheTVDB](https://www.thetvdb.com/), but focused on fanvids. Having a centralized index of fanvids is particularly useful for allowing programs like [Plex](https://plex.tv) to fetch metadata for specific fanvids, which can be used to display correct thumbnails, bucket fanvids appropriately, and more.

The FanvidDB project's code is open-source and hosted on GitHub.

- [FanvidDB/fanviddb-server](https://github.com/FanvidDB/fanviddb-server): The backend and frontend of the server, and the documentation site.
- [FanvidDB/FanvidDB.bundle](https://github.com/FanvidDB/FanvidDB.bundle): The Plex metadata agent.
