# Using FanvidDB with Plex

On the machine where you run your Plex Media Server:

1. Locate your Plug-Ins folder following [these instructions](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201106098-how-do-i-find-the-plug-ins-folder/)
2. Download FanvidDB.bundle.zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/FanvidDB/FanvidDB.bundle/releases)
3. Unzip and move FanvidDB.bundle into your Plug-Ins folder.
4. Restart your Plex Media Server and set your fanvid library to use the FanvidDB Agent.

You should now be able to pull fanvid metadata to your Plex! If something is missing or incorrect in FanvidDB, you can [add or fix it yourself](/contributing/fanvid-data.html)!
